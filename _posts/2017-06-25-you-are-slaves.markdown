Hello, everyone, as is showed on the screen, today we are going to talk about the topic about power. I represent our group to give the speech. We hold the view that people want to do right things, so they will avoid abusing power.
Let’s begin with the system of checks and balance.

In the system set up by the U.S. Constitution, the national government is divided into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The three branches are distinct and have checks and balances on each other.
Next, let’s figure out the three tips followed. 1. What power we are talking about today, 2.how to define abusing power 3.what goal we want to achieve by getting and using power.

Let’s go through the 3 problems one by one.

First, Power is a key sociological concept, Max Weber has defined it as the ability to control others, events, or resources;
Second, how can we judge whether power is been abused? When people do things beyond their power or make benefits from their power or they do bad things using power may be called abusing power. You can see two examples listed on the screen.
Third, apparently, we want to do right things, and we need power to achieve our goals. What goals? 

For government, there are three points. 1.to keep a relatively peaceful domestic political environment. 2. to keep a steady development. 
For individuals and groups, we want to do right things-------the pursue of justice and the persistence in principles.

Ok, now we are clear, next I will demonstrate from the following four aspects. The history of formation of American spirits, democracy, American culture and people’s principle, social norm and social system. In the former two parts, we will concentrate on the subjectivity of individuals. you will see the values of Americans. In that way , you may make a better understanding of the phrase” people want do what is right, they will avoid abusing power.” In the last two parts, you will learn what we have done to avoid abusing power. On the one hand, our culture identity makes a society filled with citizens full of sense of justice. They won’t make benefits from power. On the other hand, we make efforts, such as legislation, the system of checks and balance, democratic systems and so on, to make sure that power won’t be abused.

**1)	The history of formation of American spirits**

<b> 1.	Human nature inherited from Europe </b>

During the Reformation in the sixteen century, Puritans came into being with strong pursuit of equality and opposition of the despotic regime. Persecuted by the British king, CharlesⅠ, they migrated to North America for freedom. This first group of immigrants signed the Mayflower Compact in which the principle of freedom and equality became the root of American ideology and culture.
The revolution thoughts rooting deeply in their hearts blossomed on the expansion of land in America. They established the fundamental beliefs of America: refuse despotic regime, hate the differences between social class, advocate equality, pursue fairness and justice. Regardless of the origin they believe almost all human beings want to do what is right.

<b> 2.	Human nature developing from itself <b/>

American westward expansion process is a return to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line, and a new development for that area. Bringing new opportunities, the expansion continuously collides with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character (Frederick. J. Turner, The significance of frontier in American history). The more American moved westward, the more they get rid of the European influence, and formed a more unique American character: united, friendly and genuine.
In the process of expansion and development in America, the common ideal of building the country and creating better life made them combine closely and unite compactly. Driven by common interests, they tend to show respect to everyone for the same sincere and nice human nature in them, and thus they are affable all the time.

Under such background, the United States has formed a belief in pursuing justice and equality which is the core ideology of Americans of all generations.

**2)	Democracy**

Democracy is "a system of government in which all the people of a state or polity ... are involved in making decisions about its affairs, typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly." (From Wikipedia)  The cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the occupation of a citizen in the United States. 
Regarding democracy,

On the one hand, It gives people a chance to secure their own rights, showing that all people are equal. It reminds people of the fact that no one is superior to others, so people’s ideas are equal important. If people abuse power, they are ignoring others’ voices, Democracy is "a system of government in which all the people of a state or polity ... are involved in making decisions about its affairs, typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly."(From Wikipedia) 

On the one hand, It gives people a chance to secure their own rights, showing that all people are equal. It reminds people of the fact that no one is superior to others, so people’s ideas are equal important. If people abuse power, they are ignoring others’ voices. Since people want to do what is right, they will avoid this from happening. 

On the other hand, the realization of democracy in America in turn proves that people manage to avoid abusing power. According to the Democracy Index, the score of United States is 8.11, classified as full democracy. If people abuse power, it would be hard to establish democracy. Of course it would be impossible for such a country to be considered as a democratic one.

**3)	American culture and people’s principle**

Hegel, a leading German philosopher during Marx's early studies, theorized that social life and society grew out of thought.  Now let’s think about it: In the power system, what role do people’s thoughts play in avoiding power from abusing?

In the first place, for better understanding, we need to be clear of something. Regarding abusing power, there are two subject of it, the government represents the public powers, while citizens, whether ordinary person or assemblyman, are in charge of their own private power. Based on the two subject above, we will figure some illustrates both individually and collectively to make it clear that how America culture, in other words, American’s belief and principles in dealing with things, play a key part in power system of society.
On the one hand, self-constraint developed out of people’s thoughts. It in turn plays a key part in forming the environment in which people do things for goodness. 

Surrounded by people full of sense of justice, living in a highly democratic society, it is easy for one to stick to principles in social life, especially in using individual power.

For example, in contrast with China, America does better in freedom of speech. However, to some degree, there is much more restrict in speech sometimes in American, for people have strong sense responsibility and awareness of their own rights, which reflect that people won’t abusing the right they enjoy, it is applied to power using.

Another example is the Classification of audio and video products, which originated in 1990’s, in order to create a relatively pure environment for teenagers, meanwhile keeping a rapid development in film industry. MPAA established the system. In conclusion, the two examples together prove that Americans, person or the collective, when pursuing their own interests, will put the principle, you can put it as responsibility to society, in the first place. 

Under such circumstance, it is no doubt that they won’t abuse power. What’s more, the deeply rooted justice thought, which almost every American film is filled with, as one of their principles and beliefs, make it impossible for them to abuse personal power.
On the other hand, American culture plays a key part in social-constraints. For example, the separation of religion and government, in some ways, is for the purpose of avoiding the power of religion being abused. It can be proved in the contrast with some Islamic state.
To sum up, government or citizens, in such a culture environment, won’t let things like abusing power happen. 

**4) social norm and social system**

We want to do what is right, and are trying so hard to realize the beautiful aspiration which people are longing for. The best trial during human history is making rules to restrain power. 

Being bound by legal and moral ties, we can not only avoid abusing power but use it to do good to our people. 

Will power be abused? It may depends on the person who are using it, but we have been trying our best to avoid abusing power.
Just as the American constitution preface says:” We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” People have a strongly desire to live a better life and they do try to achieve it. The ideal society is on the basis of ordering, according to Montesquieu, “ Unfettered power lead to corruption inevitably”. 

To some degree, the system of Check and balance is a reflection of people’s efforts to avoid power being abused. When the constitution was drafted, the father of America must have being thinking of it.


To sum up, people want to do what is right, and they have made efforts to avoid power being abused. such as legislations and making rules.

>1.	human nature formed through American history convinced us of people’s belief in pursuing justice and freedom , <br>
>2.	the realization of democracy in America in turn proves that people manage to avoid abusing power, <br>
>3.	An internal restriction both to individuals and governments formed from America culture.<br>
>4.	Social norms and systems play a more important role in restricting power. 

**Miranda warning**

  For instance, we always see this in movies like “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.” The famous word comes from Miranda warning that was a boy called Miranda who had be accused of rape and kidnap and had be forced to admit his guilty. But he had chose to appeal and SJC had voted to defeasance the judge of local court for the policeman had not let Miranda into due constitutional right and had reiterated the rules about interrogate, and that’s Miranda warning.
  Court can avoid policeman’s power from abusing through making law. That’s the try, the awareness and belief of justice, we will establish a better world.
